# DC_Projects
A collection of projects I have completed through DataCamp.  These projects required skills (both basic and advanced) central to the data science work flow and allowed me to further my studies in a practical and applied setting.

These skills include, but are not limited to:
  - Data Cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Interactive Data Visualizations
  - Machine Learning
  - Interpreting / Communicating Results
  
Look into the projects for more specifics!
